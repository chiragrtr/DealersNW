1)

The others' broadcasts div gets refreshed every 30 seconds so when entering bid price, days or hours,
 our inputted data is lost due to refresh.

2)  SKIP------------SKIP----------SKIP

After we create a broadcast, the form doesn't revert to its default state, i.e. doesn't show "Select your make",
"select your model" and "select color", rather it shows the data selected during creation of broadcast.

3)

Can't view my broadcasts when there are bids if we show them in "latest first" form. So reverted back to oldest first for the time being.

4)

Hours to be entered in others' open broadcast, while placing bid should not be greater than 24.

5)  DONE------------DONE-----------DONE

In show_Others_Broadcasts "Broadcast By" should display dealer name, not dealer id.

6)

In my broadcasts (both open and closed), bidder id is displayed but we want bidder name and contact details to be shown.

7)

You can bid a negative or zero value in price and delivery time.
