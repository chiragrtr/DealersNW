1)

The others' broadcasts div gets refreshed every 30 seconds so when entering bid price, days or hours,
 our inputted data is lost due to refresh.

After we create a broadcast, the form doesn't revert to its default state, i.e. doesn't show "Select your make",
"select your model" and "select color", rather it shows the data selected during creation of broadcast.
